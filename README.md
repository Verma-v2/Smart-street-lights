# Smart-street-lights
This code to test smart street lights. 
This can help us to get a convenient solution for street lights using IOT and smart sensors like PIR and others and can help us to save energy in an efficient way.
Now I'm this code is to control things using BLYNK open source application to control things. 
like TIME schedule setup for three lamp using one micro-controller. 
But, in real model we need to design this individually. 
But, you can use this for your college project presentation or maybe you can change the code in your own way to make a more efficient way to save energy.

You are free to use, modify this code as per your convience. but, we are responsible for any physical damage caused by the misuse of code.
Test things in care of a mentor.
I will try to write a blog soon about this to make things easier to understand.
Thank you:)
